# RestaRules Specification

## 1. Front Matter

**Status:** Draft

**Specification Version:** Draft 0.2

**Date:** March 2026

### Abstract

RestaRules defines a machine-readable JSON document that restaurants and other hospitality venues can publish to express conduct rules governing automated AI agent interactions. The document is hosted at a well-known URI path (`/.well-known/agent-venue-rules.json`) and covers policies including disclosure requirements, permitted communication channels, rate limits, party size handling, deposit policies, and escalation conditions. This specification describes the document format, field semantics, discovery mechanism, and the decision procedure agents are expected to follow when processing a RestaRules file.

## 2. Introduction

AI agents are increasingly interacting with restaurants — making reservations, calling host stands, modifying bookings, and cancelling on behalf of users. These interactions are growing in volume and variety, but venues currently have no standardized way to communicate their rules and expectations to the agents acting on their behalf or on behalf of diners.

RestaRules addresses this gap. It defines a simple JSON document that a venue publishes at a predictable URL. Any agent — whether a voice assistant, a booking bot, a concierge service, or a search engine — can fetch this document before interacting with the venue and adjust its behavior accordingly.

The protocol is designed to be lightweight, static, and cacheable. A RestaRules file requires no authentication to fetch, no API integration to serve, and no ongoing maintenance beyond updating the file when venue policies change. It follows the same pattern as `robots.txt` — a voluntary, machine-readable policy file hosted at a well-known path — applied to the domain of agentic commerce rather than web crawling.

## 3. Scope

This specification defines:

- The JSON document format for expressing venue conduct rules
- The well-known URI path for hosting the document
- The semantics of each field in the document
- The decision procedure agents should follow when processing the document
- Conformance requirements for agents and venues

This specification does not define:

- Authentication or identity verification mechanisms for agents
- Reservation protocols or booking lifecycle semantics
- Payment processing or financial transactions
- Availability or inventory systems
- Network-level enforcement or bot detection
- Legal compliance requirements (RestaRules is a technical standard, not legal advice)
